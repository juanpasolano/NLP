Small Hedge Funds Draw Investments as Bigger Rivals Stumble
Richard Maraviglia slowly spent January flying to Zurich, New York, Chicago and Miami to raise $250 million for his hedge fund.
Maraviglia, who now oversees about $610 million for Carlson Capital LP from London, raised the money because the almost 40 percent gain he posted last year made him a rarity: a hedge-fund manager who made money trading stocks. Hedge funds were down an average 5 percent in 2011 and those focused on equities fared even worse, losing 8.3 percent, Hedge Fund Research Inc. says.
Though the largest hedge funds continue to attract the bulk of the industry’s incoming money given their perceived lower risk, Maraviglia has outperformed better-known rivals including Paulson & Co., which manages $23 billion, and Lansdowne Partners Ltd., with $12.5 billion, which made big bets on stocks in 2011 and had their worst years ever. The 42-year-old veteran of Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LLC says small size made him nimble as stocks gyrated and enabled his individual bets to make more difference to the fund’s total returns
