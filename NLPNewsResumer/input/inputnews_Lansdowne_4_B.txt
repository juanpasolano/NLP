Lansdowne drops UK from name of $7.5 billion hedge fund
Lansdowne Partners, one of Europe's biggest hedge fund firms, is to rename its flagship $7.5 billion (4.7 billion pound) UK Equity fund, reflecting its overseas investments and allowing it to invest in emerging markets, a source close to the firm told Reuters.
The fund, run by Stuart Roden and Peter Davies, will be renamed the Lansdowne Developed Markets fund in April.
The portfolio has already been investing about half its assets outside the UK, including taking large stakes in U.S. banks, and will now be able to put up to 10 percent in emerging markets, although there are no immediate plans to do this.
Lansdowne, headed by Paul Ruddock, manages around $12.5 billion in assets and is well known for making millions shorting Northern Rock during the financial crisis prior to the stricken bank's collapse.
