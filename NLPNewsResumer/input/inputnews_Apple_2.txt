Apple Files Competition Claim Against Motorola Mobility With EU Authority
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) said Apple Inc. (AAPL) filed a complaint with the European Union’s competition authority accusing the company of violating a pledge to license industry-standard patents on fair terms.
Motorola Mobility said in a regulatory filing that it was notified of the complaint today by the European Commission. Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said the company is willing to negotiate a patent license with Apple.
Apple and Motorola Mobility have sued each other in the U.S. and Europe over technology used in smartphones, a market that researcher IDC said grew 55 percent last year. Motorola Mobility won two out of three rulings in lawsuits it filed against Apple in a Mannheim, Germany, court, and in one case forced Apple to remove some older iPhone and iPad models from its online store in Germany.
