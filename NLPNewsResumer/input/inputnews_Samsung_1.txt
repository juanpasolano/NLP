Samsung to Ally With SAP on Corporate Android
SAP AG (SAP) and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) are teaming up to make mobile devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Android operating system safer to use as corporate tools, according to people familiar with the matter.
SAP, the largest maker of enterprise-management software, and Suwon, Korea-based Samsung will present their plans next week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, said the people, who declined to be named because the details aren’t public. The cooperation will include e-mail encryption as well as making handsets compatible with device-management systems that remotely update software and toggle phone functions such as switching the camera on and off, one of the people said.
The partnership is SAP’s first deal of this kind with a maker of Android phones and follows agreements with Research in Motion Ltd. for the BlackBerry platform and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for iPhone and iPad devices. Samsung, the second-biggest smartphone manufacturer behind Apple, is aiming to sell more handsets to corporate clients after the Android platform became the most popular operating system for smartphones.
