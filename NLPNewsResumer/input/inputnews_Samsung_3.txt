STMicro Polishes Indoor Navigation for $4.3 Billion Market
STMicroelectronics NV (STM) will show improved indoor navigation tools and technology that can stop handsets taking blurred photos as it tries to keep leadership in a market that may reach $4.3 billion in 2015.
Europe’s biggest chipmaker plans to demonstrate the world’s “most accurate” indoor measurement system for mobile-phone location at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week, said Benedetto Vigna, the Geneva-based company’s general manager of MEMS and sensor products. It will also use the trade fair to unveil image-stabilization components.
MEMS, or microelectromechanical systems, are becoming ubiquitous in smartphones and tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s iPhones and iPads, providing motion-sensing for turning, tilting and tapping devices. STMicroelectronics’s indoor navigation system uses data from Wi-Fi access points, motion sensors and satellite-based positioning, and tackles the issue of “urban canyons” and indoor environments where signals from GPS satellites can’t be received, Vigna said.
