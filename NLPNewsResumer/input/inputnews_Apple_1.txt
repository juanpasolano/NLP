Goldman Sachs, Facebook, Apple, Hyundai: Intellectual Property
Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) computer programmer, walked out a New York courthouse the day after his conviction for stealing the bank’s high-speed trading code was reversed by a U.S. appeals court.
Wearing a grey sweatsuit, white tennis shoes and a huge grin, Aleynikov, 42, left the building where he had been convicted in December 2010 and entered a waiting car with his lawyer, Kevin Marino.
“Justice occasionally works,” Aleynikov told reporters as he left Feb. 17. “This was such big news to me I haven’t had any time to think about what would happen.”
Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, said he hoped to be with his three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 3. Until Feb. 17, he had been serving an eight-year sentence at the federal prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey.
