Gold Imports by India Seen Falling on Prices
Gold imports by India (INMOGOLD) are poised to decline for the first time in three years as rising prices deter jewelry buyers and investors, potentially allowing China to overtake the country as the world’s largest consumer.
Purchases may drop 7 percent to 900 metric tons this year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of eight analysts, brokers and jewelers including Rajesh Exports Ltd. (RJEX), the biggest gold-jewelry exporter. India bought a record 969 tons in 2011, according to the World Gold Council.
Bullion is climbing for the 12th year as investors seek a store of wealth amid volatility in stock markets, depreciating currencies and the threat of inflation. China’s consumption may surpass India this year after surging 20 percent to 769.8 tons in 2011, the council says. Use in India fell 7 percent to 933.4 tons last year as the currency slumped to a record low, cooling purchases for festivals and marriages.
